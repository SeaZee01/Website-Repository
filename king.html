                    <h3>WHO WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">Martin Luther King Jr. (1929–1968) was an American Baptist minister and civil rights leader who became the most prominent figure in the fight against racial segregation and injustice in the United States. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, King grew up in a deeply segregated society, where the struggle for racial equality would shape his life and work. His strong belief in nonviolent resistance, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, drove his leadership in the American civil rights movement.<br><br> King’s journey toward becoming a global symbol of peace and justice began with his studies in theology and his involvement in the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955. This campaign, sparked by Rosa Parks’ arrest, catapulted King into the national spotlight. His ability to lead with compassion and without violence became the foundation for his philosophy of peaceful protest, which he applied in numerous civil rights actions throughout the 1950s and 1960s.<br><br> One of King’s most significant achievements was his leadership during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, where he delivered his iconic "I Have a Dream" speech. His call for racial equality, economic justice, and an end to discrimination galvanized millions of Americans and people worldwide. King’s ability to mobilize large, peaceful demonstrations helped draw national attention to the injustices African Americans faced.<br><br> Despite facing constant threats to his life, King’s legacy continues to inspire movements for social justice, equality, and human rights. His unwavering commitment to nonviolence, his advocacy for civil rights legislation, and his dedication to ending poverty and racial injustice have made him one of the most influential leaders in American history. King’s teachings and vision for a more just society continue to shape the fight for equality to this day.
