                <h3>WHO WAS NELSON MANDELA?</h3>
                <p class="p2">Nelson Mandela (1918–2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and political leader who became the country’s first Black president, known for his unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and reconciliation. Born in the village of Mvezo in South Africa, Mandela grew up during the oppressive era of apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation. His early life was shaped by a strong sense of social justice, which would guide him throughout his lifelong struggle against racial oppression.<br><br> Mandela’s journey toward becoming a global symbol of resistance and peace began with his legal studies and early activism. He joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944, where he became a key figure in the fight against apartheid. His leadership during the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1960s armed resistance against the apartheid regime led to his imprisonment in 1962, where he would spend 27 years behind bars.<br><br> Upon his release in 1990, Mandela’s vision for a peaceful, democratic South Africa led to his pivotal role in negotiations to end apartheid. His ability to forgive his oppressors and seek reconciliation rather than revenge was central to his leadership. In 1994, Mandela became South Africa's first Black president, a moment that marked the triumph of democracy and equality over racial segregation.<br><br> Despite facing immense personal hardship, Mandela’s legacy extends far beyond his presidency. He became an international symbol of resistance to oppression, inspiring movements for justice and equality worldwide. Mandela’s dedication to peace, human rights, and reconciliation left an indelible mark on history, making him one of the most respected and admired figures of the 20th century.
