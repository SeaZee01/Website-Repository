                <h3>WHO WAS MARIE CURIE?</h3>
                <p class="p2"> Marie Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who became one of the most pioneering scientists in history. Her groundbreaking research on radioactivity not only redefined the scientific understanding of atomic processes but also paved the way for advancements in medicine and physics. Born Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, within the Russian Empire, Curie's early life was shaped by a passion for learning, despite the challenges of growing up in an occupied Poland. Her determination to pursue higher education eventually led her to Paris, where she studied at the prestigious Sorbonne.<br><br> At the Sorbonne, Curie earned degrees in physics and mathematics, breaking barriers as one of the first women in the field. In 1895, she married Pierre Curie, a physicist whose collaborative partnership with her became legendary. Together, they discovered the elements polonium and radium, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, alongside Henri Becquerel. Marie Curie became the first woman to receive this honor, marking a turning point for women in science.<br><br> Following Pierre’s tragic death in 1906, Curie continued their work with unwavering resolve. She made history again in 1911 by earning her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her achievements in isolating radium and advancing the study of radioactivity. This accomplishment cemented her place as the only person ever to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.<br><br> Beyond her scientific endeavors, Curie contributed to humanity during World War I by developing mobile X-ray units, saving countless lives on the battlefield. Despite facing significant discrimination as a woman and a foreigner, her legacy endures as a testament to perseverance, intellect, and innovation. Curie’s work not only transformed science but also inspired generations of scientists, particularly women, to pursue their ambitions and challenge societal norms.

                <h3>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h3>
                <p class="p2"> Marie Curie's groundbreaking work revolutionized the fields of physics and chemistry, leaving a profound legacy that shaped scientific progress for generations. Perhaps her most famous accomplishment is the discovery of the radioactive elements polonium and radium, which she identified in 1898 alongside her husband, Pierre Curie. This pioneering work introduced the concept of radioactivity and opened the door to an entirely new area of scientific research, transforming our understanding of atomic structure and energy.<br><br> Another monumental achievement was her role in developing the theory of radioactivity, a term she herself coined. Marie Curie's meticulous experiments provided a foundation for the study of radioactive elements and earned her a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which she shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel. Remarkably, she later received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry in 1911, for her isolation of pure radium and her detailed study of its properties. This made her the first person ever to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.<br><br> In addition to her groundbreaking discoveries, Curie made significant contributions to medicine, particularly during World War I. She developed portable X-ray units, often called "Little Curies," which were used to diagnose injuries on the battlefield, saving countless lives. Her efforts demonstrated the practical applications of her research and established the foundation for future advancements in medical imaging and cancer treatment.<br><br> Marie Curie's perseverance in the face of adversity also helped pave the way for women in science. As the first woman to earn a doctorate in France and the first female professor at the University of Paris, she inspired generations of scientists to break barriers and pursue their passions. Her work not only bridged the worlds of physics and chemistry but also connected scientific innovation with real-world impact.
